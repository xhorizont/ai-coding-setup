# Coding Guidelines

- Prefer readable, maintainable code with docstrings where useful.
- Follow PEP 8, Black formatting, and Ruff lint hints for Python.
- Keep functions small and focused; document complex logic.
- Add logging around critical operations (without leaking secrets).
- Update tests when changing behavior.
